## Task 1: 

**SRE:** is a collection of actions that take care of the reliability, scalability, and performance of software systems. It icludes implementing proactive procedures, such as defining Service Level Objectives (SLOs), monitoring, and incident response, to maintain the stability and availability of applications.

There are famous key metrics used in this concept to monitor the main critera for a high effieciency system. These key metrices are known as "The Golden Four Stars":

- **Latency:** defined as the period needed to serve a request. There are mainly two types: one for successful and one for failed

- **Traffic:** This indiciates the amount of demand and orders being applied on the system 

- **Errors:** It expalins the rate of the requests that fail(Relibility). the failure of the request can be by policy, implicity, or explicity

- **Saturation:** This indicates the utilization and how full the system (Availablity) is from an high-level point of view.

### Examples:

In the following section we will briefly talk about some live cases about Service Level Agreement in big software companies.

* **Microsoft:** The company specified some metrices for commitment for Virus Detection, found in the following link,  
  https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services  
  , such metrices are : 
  1. Virus and Blocking S.L
  2. Spam Effectiveness Service Level
  3. False Positive Service Level
   


- **Google Earth Engine :** Google has stated many SLA metrices for each sub-service it provides, one of them is *Google Earth*. Below we will see some the metrices defined by them, found in the following link: https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine/sla  
  
  1. "Back-off Requirements"
  2. "Covered Service"
  3. "Downtime"
  4. "Downtime Period" 
  5. "Error Rate"
  6. "Financial Credit"
   

   #### In conclusion:
   The SLA, along with Service Level Objective (SLO), and Service Level Indicator (SLI) are crucial tools that define the expectatoins between the company and the costumer, achieve the internal goals sat by company, and evaulate the perforamance of service.
